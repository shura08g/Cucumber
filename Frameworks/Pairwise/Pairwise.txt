Pairwise Testing - Combinatorial Test Case Generation

Pairwise (a.k.a. all-pairs) testing is an effective test case generation technique 
that is based on the observation that most faults are caused by interactions of at 
most two factors. Pairwise-generated test suites cover all combinations of two therefore 
are much smaller than exhaustive ones yet still very effective in finding defects.

Installing
	gem install pairwise

Usage

	Pairwise and Ruby

		Pairwise.combinations will return an array of input combinations.

		Here’s an example using pairwise with Rspec:

		require 'rubygems'
		require 'pairwise'

		describe “something” do Pairwise.combinations([1,2], [1,2], [2,3]).each do |(event_id, new_event_id, media_id)| it “should do something with these input values” do … end end end

	Pairwise and Cucumber
	
	Scenario Outline: Visiting events with another events media
		Given I have a <event without media>
		And I have a <media item> attached to <event with media>
		When I go to the <media item> page for the <event without media>
		Then I should be redirected
		And I should see the <media item> in the <event with media>
	Examples:
		|media item|event without media|event with an media|

		Create a yaml file with your inputs:

		event with image: [Football, Basketball, Soccer]
		event without image: [Football, Basketball, Soccer]
		media: [Image, Video, Music]

		If you want to force the ordering of your inputs:

		- event with image: [Football, Basketball, Soccer]
		- event without image: [Football, Basketball, Soccer]
		- media: [Image, Video, Music]

		Run pairwise passing the input file

		$ pairwise inputs.yml

		This will output a table ready to be used in your Cucumber features.


		| media | event without image | event with image |
		| Image | Football            | Football         |
		| Image | Basketball          | Basketball       |
		| Image | Soccer              | Soccer           |
		| Video | Football            | Soccer           |
		| Video | Basketball          | Football         |
		| Video | Soccer              | Basketball       |
		| Music | Football            | Basketball       |
		| Music | Basketball          | Soccer           |
		| Music | Soccer              | Football         |
